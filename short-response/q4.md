# Question

Suppose you have an app that sells phones being served at `www.phones.com`. To view a single phone's details, the user navigates to the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5` where the number `5` is the id of a particular phone.

Using React Router, there is a corresponding route defined to render the `PhoneDetails` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/phones/:phoneId" element={<PhoneDetails />} />
```

Within the `PhoneDetails` component, `useParams` extracts the value of the `phoneId` path parameter (`5`) from the URL `www.phones.com/phones/5`

```jsx
const PhoneDetails = () => {
  const { phoneId } = useParams();
  
  // code to render the phone details
}
```

What is the data type of `phoneId`?

# Answer
`phoneId` is in the form of key-value pairs. We know this because `phoneId` is being destructured by being inside curly braces (`{}`). This would mean the data type of `phoneId` is a string.

What data type is phoneId when it is destructured?
