# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
I think the main/overall benefit of using SPAs is that it is a faster process. "Faster" in the sense of how components are loading because only the ones who are being interactive with are getting rendered. Since it is a "simple" single-page app, I assume it is "lightweight" and can be tested on computers or phones as a result. 

# Feedback

Yup, the main reason being that they are faster because they are more lightweight!
