# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
* I think the answer is #3 (`/products/5`) because after the second  `/`, an `id` value is being expected. 

* If it was `/products/:productName`, then it would have been #2 (`/products/apple`). 

* I do not think we are being asked about the specifics of `5`, so the answer would not be #4 (`/products/5/about`). 

* Lastly, #1 (`/products`) is not considering getting anything specific like an `id` in `products`, so it is not the answer.
