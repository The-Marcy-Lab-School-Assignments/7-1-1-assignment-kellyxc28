# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
* The answer would be both #2 (`/products/apple`) and #3 (`/products/5`) because `:id` is anything that is directly within `products`. 

* I do not think we are being asked about the specifics of `:id`, so the answer would not be #4 (`/products/5/about`). 

* Lastly, #1 (`/products`) is not considering getting anything specific like an `id` in `products`, so it is not the answer.


# Feedback

The answer to this question would be both 2 and 3 unless there is a route that is more specific included such as `products/apple`.
