# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer
ReactRouter is a package for **client-side routing** as the simulation of navigating/switching between webpages is for users to see/experience. We are not actually switching between webpages, again, we are just simulating it. This is done by rendering certain components in a certain sequence.
